        Greetings!My name is Erick a.k.a Neo, and am a Tech enthusiast
        especially <br />
        in products for the Web. My interest for Tech started way back but had'nt
        <br />
        thought i would start building digital products/software myself.
        <br />
        In 2021 I started with back-end projects using javaScript-NodeJs. Later PHP,
        <br />
        and got more interested in the front-end development.
        <br /> <br />
        Today, I have had opportunities to be part teams and have contrubited to
        <br />
        various projects that are currently live. See at the projects section.
        <br />
        Here are the few technologies that I have built with; <br /> <br />
        <span class="text-xl font-bold text-green-400">* </span> JavaScript
        (ES6+)<br />
